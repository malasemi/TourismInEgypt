<h1 class="title">Jet Boating on River Nile</h1>

<p>
It’s the longest river in the world and is the central focus of many myths and legends, which is why spending your time on the Nile River is a must. You’ll get to travel the river in the same way the people of Egypt did so long ago on an open-decked boat called a felucca. These boats offer canvas shelters to provide sun shade and cushions to lie back, relax and enjoy the views along the river. Trips are typically multi-day so passengers sleep under the open skies. While these boats aren’t luxury yacht calibre, the experience of sleeping under the stars on the River Nile is an incredible experience.
